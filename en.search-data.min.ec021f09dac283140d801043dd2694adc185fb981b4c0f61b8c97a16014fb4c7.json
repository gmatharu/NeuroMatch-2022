Somatosensory : of or pertaining to sense or sensation, conveying sensation. Notes # Brain vs the Mind # brain: is the hardware, the physical part. Since the brain(hardware) consumes around 20% of body oxygen, it might be doing something imp. mind: Software, find patterns, instruction set and algo. Somehow the dynamics/interactions of the hardware gives rise to the mind. Functional Division # Brain can be divided by the function on the cortex. Common areas consist of: Visual Cortext in the Occipital Lobe, Auditory Cortex, Somatosensory Cortex. Sub cortical regions: older regions by evolution Neurons # Functional understanding on higher level is not enough\nIn order to understand how the hardware interplay might lead to thoughts(mind) we need to understand the smallest unit of brain: Neurons\nStructurally Neurons like most cells have a Nucleus and Other cell bodies. Most important parts of a Neuron are the Axon: Send ourputs to other other Neurons and the Dendrites: receive inputs from other Neurons.\nImage Credits - Foundations of Neuroscience by Casey Henley Action Potential\nIs the currency of information processing in the brain Neurons of different type tends to speak a language of sorts by their spiking(firing) patterns. Number/diversity does not matter as for example, an Elephant has ~3 times more neurons than Humans, it\u0026rsquo;s the connections and their strength that leads to the complexity of the brain. Connections b/w Neurons: Electrical \u0026amp; Chemical\nSynapse:\nis a chemical connection is more abundant than the electrical one NeuroTransmitters define excitatory or inhibitory neuron\nDale\u0026rsquo;s Dogma: Neurons can be either Ext/Inh\nNetwork of Neurons # NeoCortex layered architecture:6 layers Vertically layers are not connected in order Horizontally, the neurons connections are distance based and over long distance they make \u0026ldquo;patchy: in small areas\u0026rdquo; connections Between regions connectivity chart which shows that the connections have some structure to them. Brain complexity arises from the strength and number of the connections, these connections strength can change Brain can be thought of as a Net of Net, Local regions make a net which connects to other nets giving rise to function Question: Can a neuron connect to new neurons or does the connections remain static i.e only their strength changes? Brain Function # Behavior to brain activity gives some idea about the brain function Relate to Machine learning: Reinforcement Learning Measuring Brain Activity # Various ways to read our Brain Activity, for example: fMRI, MEG \u0026amp; EEG etc. provides different time and spatial resolution.\nVideo Lecture # Slides # "},{"id":1,"href":"/NeuroMatch-2022/pre_course/Neuro_Video_Series/Human_Psychophysics/","title":"Human Psychophysics","section":"Neuro Video Series","content":"This video lecture answers about what, why and how of psychophysics. Majority of the lecture is dedicated to how.\nWhat is Psychophysics # Psychophysics study the relationship between stimulus and sensation. In other words we could think of Psychophysics as ways/methods to estimate the system response/output by varying systematically the input to the system when we don\u0026rsquo;t have access to the internals of the system.\nWhy study Psychophysics # Its useful to understand the limits of perceptions, as for example then we can design displays which lets us enjoy the best possible experience.\nBy modelling/understanding this relationship between stimulus(input) and the sensation(output) we could theorize the internal/system representation of the stimulus.\nExamples # Contrast Sensitivity Image Credits - Brian Sims from understandinglowvision.com The fact that the height of all the bars in above image are the same and I/we can percieve them to be of different heights, indicates the limitations of our visual system. The only thing changing is the frequency of the bars.\nTrichromacy: the theory that our eyes contain three types of photoreceptors which are sensitive to different wavelengths of light and help us perceive color. Hermann von Helmholtz discovered Trichromacy through a series of Psychophysics experiments, which paved the path for later identification of 3 types of cone cells in retina. Understanding of Trichromacy helps us to design better visual displays and printing devices.\nWeber-Fechner law By performing psychophysics experiments, Weber-Fechner discovered that JND(Just Noticeable Difference), for example in weight in images varies linearly with the baseline stimulus intensity, meaning if we double the stimulus intensity we also need to double the weight shown in the image in order for us to perceive the change, indicating that the internal signal/Sensation varies logarithmically w.r.t the stimulus intensity.\nImage Credits - Kenneth M. Steele, Department of Psychology, Appalachian State University Methods/How # Personally, I found this to be the most challenging part to understand and I believe this is not meant for the introduction to the field or for beginners. I tried to read more and watched some other youtube videos to get better understanding.\nOne video which I found useful is by Kevin Roberts\nThere is a lot that is discussed in the rest of the video, which I won\u0026rsquo;t write about here as I had a bit hard time understanding, but generally what I understood is that more than required details of methods of threshold and discrimination detection are described with limitation of a simple stimulus based task.\n"}]
