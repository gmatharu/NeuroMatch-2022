This video lecture answers about **what, why and how** of *psychophysics*. Majority of the lecture is dedicated to *how*.

## What is Psychophysics

Psychophysics study the relationship between *stimulus* and *sensation*. In other words we could think of Psychophysics as ways/methods to estimate the system response/output by varying systematically the input to the system when we don't have access to the internals of the system.


## Why study Psychophysics
- Its useful to understand the limits of perceptions, as for example then we can design displays which lets us enjoy the best possible experience.

- By modelling/understanding this relationship between *stimulus(input)* and the *sensation(output)* we could theorize the internal/system representation of the stimulus.

## Examples
1. **Contrast Sensitivity** </br>

    The fact that the height of all the bars in above image are the same and I/we can percieve them to be of different heights, indicates the limitations of our visual system. The only thing changing is the *frequency* of the bars.

2. **Trichromacy**: </br>
    the theory that our eyes contain three types of photoreceptors which are sensitive to different wavelengths of light and help us perceive color. </br></br>
**Hermann von Helmholtz** discovered Trichromacy through a series of Psychophysics experiments, which paved the path for later identification of 3 types of cone cells in retina.</br></br>
Understanding of Trichromacy helps us to design better visual displays and printing devices.

3. **Weber-Fechner law**</br>
    By performing psychophysics experiments, *Weber-Fechner* discovered that **JND(Just Noticeable Difference)**, for example in weight in images varies linearly with the baseline stimulus intensity, meaning if we double the stimulus intensity we also need to double the weight shown in the image in order for us to perceive the change, indicating that the *internal signal/Sensation* varies *logarithmically* w.r.t the stimulus intensity.

## Methods/How

Personally, I found this to be the most challenging part to understand and I believe this is not meant for the introduction to the field or for beginners. I tried to read more and watched some other youtube videos to get better understanding.

One video which I found useful is by *Kevin Roberts*

There is a lot that is discussed in the rest of the video, which I won't write about here as I had a bit hard time understanding, but generally what I understood is that more than required details of methods of **threshold and discrimination detection** are described with limitation of a simple stimulus based task.
