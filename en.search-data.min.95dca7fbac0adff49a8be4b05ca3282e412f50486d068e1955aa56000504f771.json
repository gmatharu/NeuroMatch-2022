Somatosensory : of or pertaining to sense or sensation, conveying sensation. Notes # Brain vs the Mind # brain: is the hardware, the physical part. Since the brain(hardware) consumes around 20% of body oxygen, it might be doing something imp. mind: Software, find patterns, instruction set and algo. Somehow the dynamics/interactions of the hardware gives rise to the mind. Functional Division # Brain can be divided by the function on the cortex. Common areas consist of: Visual Cortext in the Occipital Lobe, Auditory Cortex, Somatosensory Cortex. Sub cortical regions: older regions by evolution Neurons # Functional understanding on higher level is not enough\nIn order to undertsand how the hardware interplay might lead to thoughts(mind) we need to understand the smallest unit of brain: Neurons\nstructurally Neurons like most cells have a Nucleus and Other cell bodies. Most important parts of a Neuron are the Axon: Send ourputs to other other Neurons and the Dendrites: receive inputs from other Neurons.\nImage Credits - Foundations of Neuroscience by Casey Henley Action Potential\nis the currency of info processing in the brain Neurons of different type tends to speak a language of sorts by their spiking(firing) patterns. Number/diversity does not matter as for example an Elephant has ~3 times more neurons than Humans, it\u0026rsquo;s the connections and their strength that leads to the complexity of the brain. Connections b/w Neurons: Electrical \u0026amp; Chemical\nSynapse:\nis a chemical connection is more abundant than the electrical one NeuroTransmitters define excitatory or inhibatory neuron\nDale\u0026rsquo;s Dogma: Neurons can be either Ext/Inh\nNetwork of Neurons: # NeoCortex layered architechture:6 layers Vertically layers are not connected in order Horizontally, the neurons connections are distance based and over long distance they make \u0026ldquo;patchy: in small areas\u0026rdquo; connections Between regions connectivity chart Brain complexity arises from the strength and number of the connections, these connections strengh can change Brain can be though of as a Net of Net, Local regions make a net which connects to other nets giving rise to function Question: Can a neuron connect to new neurons or does the connections remain static i.e only their strength changes? Brain Function # Behavior to brain activity gives some idea about the brain function Relate to Machine learning: Reinforcement Learning Measuring Brain Activity # Various ways to read our Brain Activity, for example: fMRI, MEG \u0026amp; EEG etc. provides different time and spatial resolution\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/NeuroMatch-2022/pre_course/neuro/human_psychophysics/","title":"Human Psychophysics","section":"Neuro Video Series","content":"HS\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/NeuroMatch-2022/pre_course/neuro/behavioral_readout/","title":"Behavioral Readout","section":"Neuro Video Series","content":"BR\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/NeuroMatch-2022/pre_course/neuro/live_in-_lab/","title":"Live In Lab","section":"Neuro Video Series","content":"LIL\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/NeuroMatch-2022/pre_course/neuro/stimulus_representation/","title":"Stimulus Representation","section":"Neuro Video Series","content":"Stimulus Representation\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/NeuroMatch-2022/pre_course/neuro/neurotransmitters/","title":"Neurotransmitters","section":"Neuro Video Series","content":"Neurotransmitters\n"},{"id":6,"href":"/NeuroMatch-2022/pre_course/neuro/neurons_to_consciousness/","title":"Neurons to Consciousness","section":"Neuro Video Series","content":"Neurons to Consciousness\n"}]
